(First cut at build for external SEACAS distribution. Assumes you know
 what the codes are and how to use them.)

1. Create the directory which will serve as the root of the SEACAS
installation.  This will be your AccessRoot.

2. Checkout the SEACAS source code:
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@seacas.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/seacas login
   (hit return for password)	
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@seacas.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/seacas co -P ACCESS

3. Merge in the exodusII and nemesis libraries:
   cd ACCESS/libraries
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@exodusii.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/exodusii login
   (hit return for password)	
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@exodusii.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/exodusii co -P exodusii nemesis 

4. Download netcdf.  At this time, netcdf-4.0 is recommended.
   * cd ../netcdf
   * Download netcdf-4.0.1.tar.gz from 
       http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netcdf-4.0.1.tar.gz
   * tar zxvf netcdf-4.0.1.tar.gz
   * If the untar does not create a netcdf-4.0.1 directory, modify the
     Imakefile in the current directory such that V_NUM specifies the
     correct name
   * Modify the following defines in libsrc/netcdf.h and libsrc4/netcdf.h:

#define NC_MAX_DIMS     65536    /* max dimensions per file */
#define NC_MAX_VARS     524288   /* max variables per file */
#define NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS 8        /* max per variable dimensions */

5. cd back to your AccessRoot location (see step 1)   

6. Edit ACCESS/itools/config/cf/site.def
   * Update the Owner and Group defines with your username and
     whatever group you want the codes available as.

   * Update the AccessRoot to point to the AccessRoot in step 1.

7. Edit the ACCESS/itools/config/cf/linux.cf (or corresponding file if
   not on linux)

   * If not building on a 64-bit system, change the Build64BitAccess
     define to NO

   * Pick your compiler.  Typically, gcc-3.X would be the GCCG77
     define and gcc-4.X would be the GCC4GFORTRAN define. If using a
     gcc-3.X or gcc-4.0 compiler, you cannot build a 64-bit version due to
     some strangeness in the way we originally set up the fortran builds;
     gcc-4.1 and later work fine.

   * If the compiler is not in your path, locate the CcCmd,
     CplusplusCmd, and FortranCmd definitions in the proper area and update
     the path to point to the correct compiler location.

8. Build the software.
   * cd to AccessRoot as specified in step 1.
   * sh ACCESS/scripts/buildSEACAS
   * Enter option 1 -- Build all of SEACAS (including the Imake tools)
   * The SEACAS root directory default should be correct; otherwise
     you are in the wrong directory when you execute the script.
   * Return for the group or enter a new group.
   * Typically, choose '10' if building on Linux for the BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS
   * Follow prompts and hope no errors occur...

To use this installation of SEACAS:
 CSH:
   * setenv ACCESS /path/specified/as/AccessRoot
   * set path=($ACCESS/etc $ACCESS/bin $path)
 SH: 
   * export ACCESS=/path/specified/as/AccessRoot
   * export PATH=$ACCESS/etc:$ACCESS/bin:$PATH
