Instructions for Nemesis examples

To change number of processors:
  1.  In problem subdirectory, change nem_slice_command file to include 
      mesh dimensions for desired number of processors (e.g., mesh=3x3 
      yields 9 processors).
  2.  Run nem_slice_command; a Nemesis decomposition file is produced
      (*.nemI).
  3.  Change LB file line in nem_spread.inp to be the Nemesis decomposition
      file produced in step 2.
  4.  Run nem_spread.  The parallel Nemesis files will be produced in
      ti_0* directories.
  5.  In zdrive.inp, change File Name to the base name for the files produced
      in step 4.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nem_ti_20k
  3D Tilted Reactor mesh with approx. 20k elements.
  Run on 36 processors (for committed values).
  Random Chaco decomposition initially.
  No vertex weighting.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answers differ for ParMETIS tests on linux platforms 
Suspect difference in rand() is the cause.
On linux, rand() returns values in the range 0 to 2147483647; on
Solaris, it returns values in the range 0 to 32767.  (See definition of
RAND_MAX in <stdlib.h>.)
