 \chapter{Introduction}

\exo{} is the successor of the widely used finite element 
(FE) data file format EXODUS [1] (henceforth referred to as EXODUS I)
developed by Mills-Curran and Flanagan. It continues the concept of a
common database for multiple application codes (mesh generators,
analysis codes, visualization software, etc.) rather than
code-specific utilities, affording flexibility and robustness for both
the application code developer and application code user. By using the
\exo{} data model, a user inherits the flexibility of using a large
array of application codes (including vendor-supplied codes) which
access this common data file directly or via translators.

The uses of the \exo{} data model include the following:

\begin{itemize}
 \item problem definition -- mesh generation, specification 
of locations of boundary conditions and load application, specification 
of material types.
\item simulation -- model input and results output.
\item visualization -- model verification, results postprocessing, 
data interrogation, and analysis tracking.
\end{itemize}
