Some time back there was some discussion about makedepend and its
failing to evaluate hex values in expressions properly.  I was just
looking at the source, and noticed that it seems to evaluate hex
*constants*, but not macros defined with hex values.  It seems
the ability to do hex constants was obtained by switching from atoi()
to strtol() in ifparser.c/parse_number().  Looking further,
cppsetup.c/_my_eval_variable() had an instance of atoi(), and
switch that to strtol() as well seems to give makedepend the
ability to do macros defined as hex constants.  Can it really
be that simple?

Patch below, apply in config/makedepend.

      } while (s);
  
+     return strtol(var, &var, 0);
+ #if 0
      return atoi(var);
+ #endif
  }
