README for imboot

This README has the following sections:

I)   How to build and install imboot if you you have xmkmf and the
     X11R[4, 5, or 6] configuration files.
II)  How to build and install imboot by hand.
III) How to move the configuration root directory

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section I. Installing imboot

1) Look in Imakefile and find the line that sets the value of CONFIGROOTDIR:

	CONFIGROOTDIR = /usr/local/lib/config

This is the imboot configuration root; it's the directory under which are
installed the various sets of configuration files that imboot know about.
Each set of files is installed in its own directory.

If you want to use a different directory, change the value of CONFIGROOTDIR.

2) If imboot has not been installed on your system already, you'll need
to create the configuration root directory:

	% mkdir /usr/local/lib/config	(or whatever pathname you're using)

3) Build the Makefile, then build imboot and the manual page imboot.man:

	% xmkmf
	% make

4) Determine whether the installation directories for imboot and imboot.man
are appropriate for your system:

	% make -n install
	% make -n install.man

These commands show you where the Makefile will install the files.  If
the locations are suitable, install the files:

	% make install
	% make install.man

Otherwise install the files by hand.  imboot can be installed in any
directory in your search path.  Be sure to make it executable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section II. Installing imboot by hand

To install imboot and imboot.man by hand, first run the following commands:

	% cp imboot.cpp imboot
	% chmod +x imboot
	% cp imboot.man.cpp imboot.man

Then edit imboot and imboot.man, replacing all instances of XCOMM with #
and all instances of CONFIGROOTDIR with /usr/local/lib/config (or with
the full pathname of whatever directory you use for your configuration
root).

Finally, install imboot and imboot.man in locations appropriate for your
system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section III. How to move the configuration root directory

If you want to move the configuration root directory, you need to
rebuild imboot and move any configuration files that are already installed
under the old configuration root.  For concreteness, assume the old
configuration  root is /usr/local/lib/config and the new configuration
root is /var/lib/config.  (Make the appropriate substitutions for your
own system.)

1) Build and install imboot with the new value of CONFIGROOTDIR, using
the instructions above in section I or II.

2) Create the new configuration root directory:

	% mkdir /var/lib/config

3) Move any files that may already be installed under the old configuration
root.

If you want to be lazy, just populate the new configuration root with
symlinks to each directory under the old configuration root.  That way
you can use existing files without actually moving them.  Commands to
create the symlinks are shown below for csh and sh:

csh:	cd /usr/local/lib/config
	foreach dir (*)
		ln -s /usr/local/lib/config/$dir /var/lib/$dir
	end

sh:	cd /usr/local/lib/config
	for dir in *; do
		ln -s /usr/local/lib/config/$dir /var/lib/$dir
	done

To actually copy the files, rather than making symlinks, a command something
like the following will do the job (on some systems, you may need to use xof
rather than xf):

	% (cd /usr/local/lib ; tar cf - config) | (cd /var/lib ; tar xf -)

Then cd into /var/lib/config, and, for each non-symlink directory there,
change into the directory, and change the self-reference to point to the
directory you're in.  The self-reference is typically specified as the
value of ConfigDir in Project.tmpl or site.def.  But do a grep first to
find out exactly where the value is specified.

When you're done, test imboot to see that it uses the files in the new
configuration root.  When you're satisfied, remove the old configuration
root and the stuff in it.  (Do NOT remove the old configuration root
if you used the lazy method above, however!)
