Investigate use of compression, cache, and chunking from the netcdf-4 interface.
  compression would probably work good on attributes, dist factors, side info.

Groups could be used to hide the -s000X files...

Check that the endian is working...

Check parallel use -- works in classic

Could use groups instead of the parallel interface -- 
 -- metadata at the global level
 -- Each processor uses its own group.


LONGER TERM:
* Use of compound variable types.
