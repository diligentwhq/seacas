C   --*** FFSFLD *** (FFLIB) Set free-field field
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 05/07/87
C   --
C   --FFSFLD sets a free-field reader field.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   TYPE - IN - the field type:
C   --      '*' = end of fields field
C   --      ' ' = empty field
C   --      'C' = character field
C   --      'R' = real number field
C   --      'I' = integer number field
C   --   WORD - IN - the character field (if type 'C')
C   --   INUM - IN - the integer field (if type 'I')
C   --   RNUM - IN - the real field (if type 'R')
C   --   IFLD - IN - the index of the field to be set
C   --   INTYP - IN/OUT - the free-field reader type array
C   --   CFIELD - IN/OUT - the free-field reader string array
C   --   IFIELD - IN/OUT - the free-field reader integer array
C   --   RFIELD - IN/OUT - the free-field reader real array
