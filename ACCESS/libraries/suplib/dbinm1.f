C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/18/88

C   --DBINM1 reads the element block variable truth table.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NDB - IN - the database number
C   --   OPTION - IN - ' ' to not store, '*' to store all, else store options:
C   --      'T' to store element block variable truth table
C   --   NELBLK - IN - the number of element blocks
C   --   NVAREL - IN - the number of element variables
C   --   ISEVOK - OUT - the element block variable truth table;
C   --      variable i of block j exists iff ISEVOK(j,i)
C   --   IEVOK - OUT - the element block variable truth table;
C   --      variable i of block j exists iff ISEVOK(j,i) is NOT 0
C   --   IERR - OUT - the returned read error flag
C   --   * - return statement if error encountered, including end-of-file;
C   --      NO message is printed
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned in front of truth table upon entry;
C   --upon exit positioned after table.
