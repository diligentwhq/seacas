<h3>
<a NAME="System Requirements"></a>System Requirements</h3>
Zoltan was designed to run on parallel computers and clusters of workstations.
In order to build and use Zoltan, you will need:
<ul>
<li>
ANSI C compiler.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/">MPI</a> library for message
passing (version 1.1 or higher), such as MPICH or LAM.</li>

<li>
A Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux or Solaris) and
<i>gmake</i> (GNU Make) are recommended to build the library.</li>

<li>
A Fortran90 compatible compiler is required if you wish to 
<a href="ug_fortran.html">use Zoltan
with Fortran applications</a>.</li>
</ul>

Zoltan has been tested on a variety of platforms, including Linux, Solaris, Irix,
and the <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/ASCI/Red/">ASCI Red</a> Teraflop machine.
If you wish to use Zoltan on a non-Unix operating system, for example Windows NT or 2000,
you will have to port Zoltan yourself.

<h3>
<a NAME="Data Types for Object IDs"></a>Data Types for Object IDs</h3>
Application query functions and application callable library functions
use global and local identifiers (IDs) for objects. <i>All objects to be
used in load balancing must have unique global IDs.</i> Zoltan stores an
ID as an array of unsigned integers. The number of entries in these arrays
can be set using the <a href="ug_param.html#NUM_GID_ENTRIES">NUM_GID_ENTRIES</a>
and <a href="ug_param.html#NUM_LID_ENTRIES">NUM_LID_ENTRIES</a> parameters;
by default, one unsigned integer represents an ID. Applications may use
whatever format is most convenient to store their IDs; the IDs can then
be converted to and from Zoltan's ID format in the <a href="ug_query.html">application-registered
query functions</a>.
<p>The following type definitions are defined in <i>include/zoltan_types.h</i>; they can
be used by an application for memory allocation, MPI communication, and
as arguments to
<a href="ug_interface.html">load-balancing interface functions</a>
and
<a href="ug_query.html">application-registered query functions</a>.
<blockquote>typedef unsigned int <b>ZOLTAN_ID_TYPE</b>;
<br>typedef <b>ZOLTAN_ID_TYPE</b> *<b>ZOLTAN_ID_PTR</b>;
<br>#define <b>ZOLTAN_ID_MPI_TYPE</b> MPI_UNSIGNED</blockquote>
In the Fortran interface, IDs are passed as arrays of integers since unsigned
integers are not supported in Fortran. See the description of the <a href="ug_fortran_api.html#fortran ug api IDs">Fortran
interface</a> for more details.
<p>The local IDs passed to Zoltan are not used by the library; they are
provided for the convenience of the application and can contain any information
desired by the application. For instance, local array indices for objects
may be passed as local IDs, enabling direct access to object data in the
query function routines. See the <a href="ug_query.html">application-registered
query functions</a> for more details. The source code distribution contains
an example application <i><a href="../dev_html/dev_driver.html">zdrive</a></i>
in which global IDs are integers and local IDs are local array indices.
One may choose not to use local ids at all, in which case <a href="ug_param.html#NUM_LID_ENTRIES">NUM_LID_ENTRIES</a>
may be set to zero.
<p>Some Zoltan routines (e.g., 
<a href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Partition"><b>Zoltan_LB_Partition</b></a>
and 
<a href="ug_interface_mig.html#Zoltan_Invert_Lists"><b>Zoltan_Invert_Lists</b></a>)
allocate arrays of type <b>ZOLTAN_ID_PTR</b> and return them to the application.
Others (e.g., <b>Zoltan_Order</b> and 
<a href="ug_util_dd.html#DD_Find"><b>Zoltan_DD_Find</b></a>) require
the application to allocate memory for IDs.  Memory for IDs can be allocated
as follows:
<blockquote><tt>
  ZOLTAN_ID_PTR gids;<br>
  int num_gids, int num_gid_entries;<br>
  gids = (ZOLTAN_ID_PTR) <a href="ug_util_mem.html#Zoltan_Malloc">ZOLTAN_MALLOC</a>(num_gids * num_gid_entries * sizeof(ZOLTAN_ID_TYPE);<br>
</tt></blockquote>
The system call <i>malloc</i> may be used instead of 
<a href="ug_util_mem.html#Zoltan_Malloc"><b>ZOLTAN_MALLOC</b></a>.

<h3>
<a NAME="Building the Library"></a>Building the Zoltan Library</h3>
The Zoltan library is implemented in ANSI C and can be compiled with any
ANSI C compiler.&nbsp; Makefiles are included with the source code; these
makefiles require the GNU Make (gmake) utility.  The
top-level Makefile defines targets for the Zoltan library,
<a href="../dev_html/dev_driver.html">test driver</a> programs 
in C, C++ and Fortran90, and 
<a href="../dev_html/dev_view.html">two graphical utilities</a> useful
for visualization of geometric partitions.  (The test drivers and
utilities are primarily intended for use
by developers.)&nbsp; This Makefile need not be
edited to build Zoltan.&nbsp; Instead, environment-specific definitions
are specified in the configuration file, <i>Utilities/Config/Config.&lt;platform></i>,
where <i>&lt;platform></i> specifies the particular platform for which
Zoltan is being built.&nbsp; Paths to compilers, include files, and libraries
are defined in this file and are then read by the top-level Makefile.&nbsp;
Examples of configuration files for Solaris, Sandia's ASCI Red (tflop)
computer, SGI workstations, and PCs running Linux are
included in the <i>Utilities/Config</i> subdirectory.&nbsp;&nbsp; A well-commented
version of the configuration file, <i>Utilities/Config/Config.generic</i>,
is also included; this file can be used as a template for new environment-specific
files.&nbsp; The variables in these files should be edited to reflect the
new system's environment.
<p>The command for building Zoltan is shown below:
<blockquote>gmake [options] zoltan</blockquote>
where the options that may be specified are listed below.
<table WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><b>Options to gmake:</b></td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZOLTAN_ARCH=&lt;platform></i></td>

<td>Specify the target architecture for the Zoltan library.&nbsp; A corresponding
file, <i>Utilities/Config/Config.&lt;platform></i>, containing environment
definitions for <i>&lt;platform</i>>, must be created in the
<i>Utilities/Config</i>
directory.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YES_FORTRAN=1</i></td>

<td>Include Fortran support in the Zoltan library.&nbsp; By default, the
Zoltan library is built without the interface that allows use from Fortran
applications.&nbsp; If this option is specified, the
<a href="ug_fortran.html">Fortran
interface</a> is compiled and included in the library.&nbsp; Use of this
option requires that a Fortran 90 (or 95, or later) compiler is available.</td>
</tr>
</table>
As an alternative to typing the options on the gmake command line, they
may be set as environment variables; e.g., if you are using a C-shell (csh or tcsh),
type
<blockquote>
setenv ZOLTAN_ARCH <i>&lt;platform></i>
</blockquote>
or if you are using a Bourne-type shell (e.g., sh or bash), type
<blockquote>
ZOLTAN_ARCH = <i>&lt;platform>; </i>export ZOLTAN_ARCH
</blockquote>
The resulting library <i>libzoltan.a</i>, object files, and dependency files
are stored in the directory Obj_&lt;<i>platform</i>>.
<h3>
<a NAME="Testing the Library"></a>Testing the Zoltan Library</h3>
The <I>examples</I> directory contains simple C and C++ examples which use
the Zoltan library.  The Makefile in this directory has three targets:
<DL>
<DT>gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=&lt;platform> C_Examples
<DD>This builds simple C language examples that use the Zoltan library to perform load balancing.
<DT>gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=&lt;platform> CPP_Examples
<DD>This builds simple C++ language examples that use the Zoltan library 
to perform load balancing.  To build C++ applications, define CPPC to point
to your C++ compiler in the Config.&lt;platform> file.
<DT>gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=&lt;platform> all
<DD>Build both C and C++ examples.  Don't forget to define CPPC in your 
Config.&lt;platform> file.
</DL>
<p>
Some of these examples make use of a small library of support routines found in
the <I>examples/lib</I> directory.  These routines create simple test
meshes of varying sizes, perform error checking across the parallel
application, and define Zoltan call backs.
<p>
The "right" answer for these tests depends on the number of processes with
which you run the tests.  In general, if they compile successfully,
run quickly (in seconds), and produce reasonable looking output, then
you have been successful in building Zoltan.

<h3>
<a NAME="Building Applications"></a>Building Applications that use Zoltan</h3>
The C library interface is described in the include file <i>include/zoltan.h</i>;
this file should be included in all C application source files that call
Zoltan library routines. 
<p>
The <a href="ug_cpp.html">C++ interface</a> to 
Zoltan is implemented in header files which define classes that
wrap the Zoltan C library.  The file <I>include/zoltan_cpp.h</I> defines the
<B>Zoltan</B> class which encapsulates a load balancing data structure and the
Zoltan load balancing functions which operate upon it.  Include this header file
instead in your C++ application.  Note that C++ applications should call the
C function <B>Zoltan_Initialize</B> before creating a <B>Zoltan</B> object.
<p>
<a href="ug_fortran_apps.html">Fortran applications</a> must USE
<a href="ug_fortran_api.html#fortran ug api zoltan module">module zoltan</a> and 
specify <i>Zoltan/Obj_&lt;platform></i>
as a directory to be searched for module information files.
<p>
The C, C++ or Fortran application should then be linked with the Zoltan library
(built with Fortran support in the Fortran case)
and its <a href="../ug_html/ug_util.html">utility libraries</a> by including
<blockquote><i>-lzoltan </i></blockquote>
in the linking command for the application. 
Communication within
Zoltan is performed through MPI, so appropriate MPI libraries must be linked
with the application. Third-party libraries, such as <a href="ug_alg_parmetis.html">ParMETIS</a>
and <a href="http://www.gre.ac.uk/~jjg01/">Jostle</a>, must be also be
linked with the application if they were included in compilation of the
Zoltan library.&nbsp; (A courtesy copy of <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/parmetis/">ParMETIS</a>
is included with the Zoltan distribution; <a href="http://www.gre.ac.uk/~jjg01/">Jostle</a>
must be obtained directly from <a href="http://www.gre.ac.uk/~jjg01/">http://www.gre.ac.uk/~jjg01/</a>.)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
For applications that used versions of Zoltan before Zoltan v.1.3, 
only minor updates to the application build process are
needed; see the section on <a href="ug_backward.html">backward
compatibility</a> of Zoltan.
