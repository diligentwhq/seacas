<A NAME="SQE"></A>Zoltan Quality Assurance</H2>
This document describes the Software Quality Assurance (SQA)
policies and procedures used in the Zoltan project.  Zoltan developers
at Sandia and under contract to Sandia are required to follow these
software development policies.

<H3>
<A NAME="Quality_Policy"></A>Quality Policy
</H3>
The Zoltan project has been funded by a variety of DOE programs
(MICS, CSRF, ASC, and LDRD).
Thus, Zoltan is simultaneously under the umbrella of multiple quality
programs including that of the Accelerated Strategic Computing 
Initiative (ASC). 
Fortunately, all of these quality programs derive from the DOE/AL Quality 
Criteria (QC-1). 
Therefore, the Zoltan project is committed to a program of quality improvement 
targeting the QC-1 standard.  
The Zoltan team leader is the owner of the Zoltan quality program.
<p>
The entire delivered Zoltan product will be considered
a &quot;class A&quot; program under ASC program guidelines.
Modules created before the ASC guidelines had no formal QA
program and will lack ASC SQA artifacts (objective evidence). 
<p>
The  Zoltan team shall participate in all ASC reporting processes as
directed by ASC management. 
The Zoltan team will evaluate new practices to reflect ASC Program Office 
process revisions. 
FY2004 money has been committed for quality improvement. 
<p>
Research software will follow the guidelines of QC-1 which allow specific 
relaxations in the QA rigor for research activities.  
<p>



<H3><A NAME="Quality_Definition"></A>Quality Definition</H3>
<p>
The Zoltan project accepts the following definition of quality:
&quot;the totality of characteristics of a product or service that bear on
its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs.&quot; 
This is known as the &quot;fitness for use&quot; definition of quality (ANSI/ASQC A8402-1994).
<p>



<H3><A NAME="Defect_Classification"></A>Classification of Defects</H3>
The Zoltan project accepts the following system of classification of
defects:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>Critical:</b>  A defect that could lead to loss of life,
significant environmental damage, or substantial financial loss.
<br><b>Major:</b>  A non critical defect that significantly
impacts  Zoltan's fitness for use.
<br><b>Minor:</b>  A (non critical, non major) defect that
reasonably impacts Zoltan's fitness for use.
<br><b>Incidental:</b>  Any other defect which does not
reasonably reduce Zoltan's fitness for use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>




<H3><A NAME="Release_Policy"></A>Release Policy</H3>
<p>
Only the Zoltan team leader may authorize a release. 
The Zoltan team leader shall not release software with 
any known critical or major defects. 
User registration shall allow the Zoltan team to 
notify all Sandia and ASC users and recall their
defective software if a critical or major defect 
is discovered after release. 
The Zoltan team leader may determine that it is
acceptable to release software with known minor or incidental defects.
<p>




<H3><A NAME="Quality_Tools"></A>Software Quality Tools</H3>
<p> 
Because of the small scale of the Zoltan Project, only a few, simple tools
are required for use by developers:
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<b>CVS:</b>  maintains code, documentation, meeting
notes, emails, and QA program artifacts;
<br><b>Purify, PureCoverage, Quantify (Rational):</b> 
for code testing, coverage measurements, and performance analysis;
<br><b>Bugzilla:</b>  tracks bugs and requests for changes
and enhancements (deployment in FY2004);
<br><b>Mailman:</b>  creates email lists to automatically
notify users by area(s) of interest (deployment in FY2004);
<br><b>Quality Function Deployment (QFD):</b>  tracks
user requirements through implementation and testing 
(phased-in deployment in FY2004 in which one pilot project will use QFD);
<br><b>Makefiles:</b>  ensures proper compilation and linking
for all supported platforms;
<br><b>Zoltan Test Script:</b> runs 
integration, regression, release and acceptance testing; and 
<br><b>Kanban:</b>  Team Leader's white board displays
all outstanding issues, schedules, and assignments.
</BLOCKQUOTE>




<H3><A NAME="Quality_Processes"></A>Software Quality Processes</H3>
<p> 
The Zoltan's software quality process defines how work may be performed,
including
process ownership, authorization to perform, activities and their sequence
(if sequencing is required), process instructions, metrics, and checklists
(with places to identify who performed each activity). 
The only source for a process is Zoltan's CVS repository. 
Currently the following processes are defined:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>Meeting:</b> defines the process of calling
and documenting meetings;
<br><b>Development:</b> (not currently used) defines the software development 
process including
requirements, design, implementation, testing, reviews, and approvals;
<br><b>Request:</b> defines the process of
capturing user requests for new features;
<br><b>Requirement:</b>  the process of capturing user comments that
may become requirements after review and approval; 
<br><b>Review:</b>  defines the materials reviewed prior to acceptance 
for Zoltan release; and 
<br><b>Release:</b> defines the release process
including testing requirements and creation of the release product;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
A Zoltan developer initiates a process by obtaining the
current CVS version of the process, renaming it to reflect its usage, and
committing the renamed process back into CVS in an appropriate directory 
(on the same day to ensure that it is the current version). 
As a policy, the process may continue under this committed version even if its
original process is later superceded. 
After one or more activities are completed, the renamed process is updated to
reflect the results and committed back to CVS (with appropriate comments.) 
A process is completed when all required activities are completed 
including reviews
and approvals (as necessary), and committed to CVS. 
The final CVS comment should indicate that the process is complete.
