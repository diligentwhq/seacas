<h2>
<a NAME="compilation"></a>Compilation and Makefiles</h2>
The Zoltan distribution includes a main (top-level) Makefile with targets
for the Zoltan library, the test driver programs, and some graphical tools. 
When the library is
<a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#Building the Library">compiled for a specific target platform</a>, <i>A</i>, the top-level Makefile
obtains platform-specific values for platform <i>A</i> from the configuration
file <i>Utilities/Config/Config.A</i>.&nbsp; This file should
be edited to reflect the environment of the target platform <i>A</i>.&nbsp;
A subdirectory, <i>Obj_A</i>, is created, and Makefile_sub is copied into
that directory for use by gmake.
<p>
New source code files are added to the Zoltan Makefiles in two ways.  
Files added to
existing directories are added to the source files listed in the
"<i>&lt;directory_name&gt;</i>_CSRC" and "<i>&lt;directory_name&gt;</i>_INC" 
variables in <i>Zoltan/Makefile</i>, where <i>&lt;directory_name&gt;</i> 
corresponds to the existing Zoltan directory name; the files will then 
be included in the compilation of Zoltan.  
For new source code files in new directories, new variables 
"<i>&lt;directory_name&gt;</i>_CSRC" and "<i>&lt;directory_name&gt;</i>_INC"
should be added to <i>Zoltan/Makefile</i>.  These variables should also
be included in the "ZOLTAN_CSRC" variable and in the zscript target.
The variables "ALL_CSRC" and "ALL_INC" can be used as examples.
<p>
New algorithms can be added as separate libraries with which Zoltan may link.  
The implementation of the <a href="../ug_html/ug_alg_parmetis.html">ParMETIS</a>
interface in Zoltan can serve as an example.  Within the 
<i>Utilities/Config</i> files, pathnames for the new libraries and their 
include files can be specified.  Within <i>Zoltan/Makefile</i>, tests 
should be added for the definition of these paths.  If they are defined,
appropriate information should be added to the THIRD_PARTY_LIBS,
THIRD_PARTY_LIBPATH, and THIRD_PARTY_INCPATH variables in <i>Zoltan/Makefile</i>.
