C   --*** NEWNPS *** (GEN3D) Calculate 3D node sets
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 05/05/86
C   --
C   --NEWNPS calculates the node set information for the 3D database.
C   --The front and back node sets are not calculated (since they
C   --are easily derived), and they are not included in the length tally.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IDFRO - IN - ids for front surface node sets; (0) = length
C   --   IDBCK - IN - ids for back surface node sets; (0) = length
C   --   IDNPS - IN - the 2D node sets ids
C   --   NNNPS - IN - the number of nodes for each 2D set
C   --   NNNP3 - OUT - the number of nodes for each 3D set
C   --   IXNNPS - IN - the index of the first node for each 2D set
C   --   IXNNP3 - OUT - the index of the first node for each 3D set
C   --   LTNNPS - IN - the nodes for all 2D sets
C   --   LTNNP3 - OUT - the nodes for all 3D sets
C   --   FACNPS - IN - the distribution factors for all 2D sets
C   --   FACNP3 - OUT - the distribution factors for all 3D sets
C   --   IXNP - IN - the new index for each node
C   --   NRNP - IN - the number of new nodes generated for each node
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDBOUT of /DBASE/
C   --   Uses NUMNPS, LNPSNL of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Sets LNPSNO of /DBNUM3/
C   --   Uses NNREPL of /PARAMS/
