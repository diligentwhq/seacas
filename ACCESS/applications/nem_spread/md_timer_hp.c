 * HP process timer:
 *
 *   This timer is suppose to return the time in seconds taken up by the user
 * process (i.e., user time plus system time spent doing user process work).
 * This time is most naturally returned by the function clock().  However, has
 * the unfortunate property that it wraps arounds every 36 minutes. On the sun,
 * the function getrusage() can be used to return the time without this
 * wraparound problem.  However, I haven't found anything equivalent on the HP.
 * Note that the function gettimeofday() returns a very precise definition of
 * the time.  However, it is strictly a wall clock time.
