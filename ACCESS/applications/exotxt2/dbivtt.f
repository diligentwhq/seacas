C   --*** DBIVTT *** Read element variable truth table
C   --   Modified for ExodusII format 8/26/95
C   --*** DBINAM *** (EXOLIB) Read database names
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/08/88
C   --
C   --
C   --DBINAM performed a number of different input file read base
C   --on the passed in option argument.  DBINAM was split up
C   --into a number of different subroutins

C   --DBINAM reads the names of the coordinates, the element block types,
C   --and the database variables from the database.  All names are converted
C   --to uppercase and all embedded blanks within a name are removed.
C   --The element block variable truth table is also read.
C   --
C   --Note that the numbers of variables are read in this routine.
C   --
C   --This routine calls DBVINI and uses DBVIX to get the variable name
C   --indices.
C   --
C   --Dynamic memory is reserved in this routine.  If there is a problem,
C   --MEMERR is called and then this routine returns with and error IOERR=1
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NDB    - IN  - the database number
C   --   A      - OUT - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   NELBLK - IN  - the number of element blocks
C   --   NVAREL - IN  - the number of element variables; <0 if end-of-file
C   --   ISEVOK - OUT - the dynamic memory array of the element block variable
C   --                  truth table;variable i,block j exists iff ISEVOK(j,i)

C   --Routines Called:
C   --   MDRSRV - (SUPES) Reserve dynamic memory

      INTEGER NDB
      DIMENSION A(*)
      INTEGER NELBLK, NVAREL
      LOGICAL ISEVOK(NELBDM,*)
      INTEGER ITMP(NVAREL, NELBDM)

C     Read the element block variable truth table
C     call exgvtt(fileid, num_elem_blks, num_elem_var,
C                   isevok(num_elem_var, num_elem_blks, errorid)
C       isevok - num_elem_var cycles faster
      CALL EXGVTT(NDB, NELBLK, NVAREL, ITMP, IERR)
      DO 110 I = 1, NVAREL
         DO 100 IELB = 1, NELBLK
            ISEVOK(IELB,I) = (ITMP(I,IELB) .NE. 0)
 100     CONTINUE
 110  CONTINUE
