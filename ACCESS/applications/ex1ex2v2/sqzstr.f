C   --*** SQZSTR *** (STRLIB) Remove extra blanks from string
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 06/02/87
C   --
C   --SQZSTR deletes leading and extra blanks within a string.
C   --To prevent problems, an empty string is returned with a length of 1.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   STRING - IN/OUT - the string to be compressed, returned, may be
C   --      up to 132 characters long
C   --   LSTR - OUT - the new string length

C   --Routines Called:
C   --   LENSTR - (STRLIB) Find string length

      CHARACTER*(*) STRING
      INTEGER LSTR

      CHARACTER*132 TMPSTR

      IF (STRING .EQ. ' ') RETURN

      LSTR = LENSTR (STRING)

      IBLK = INDEX (STRING, '  ')
  100 CONTINUE
      IF ((IBLK .GT. 0) .AND. (IBLK .LE. LSTR)) THEN

         INOBLK = IBLK + 2
  110    CONTINUE
         IF (STRING(INOBLK:INOBLK) .EQ. ' ') THEN
            INOBLK = INOBLK + 1
            GOTO 110
         END IF

         TMPSTR = STRING(INOBLK:LSTR)
         STRING(IBLK+1:LSTR) = TMPSTR
         LSTR = LSTR - (INOBLK-IBLK-1)
         IBLK = INDEX (STRING, '  ')
         GOTO 100
