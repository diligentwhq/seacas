C   --*** LOCRL *** (TIMSEL) Find closest real value of selected values
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 11/10/87
C   --
C   --LOCRL returns the closest real value to the given value in a list of
C   --selected real values (which may not be ordered).
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   VALU - the value to be searched for
C   --   NVALUS - the number of values in the list
C   --   VALUOK - VALUS(i) is selected iff VALUOK(i)
C   --   VALUS - the list of values

      LOGICAL VALUOK(*)
      REAL VALUS(*)

      IX = 0
      DIF = 1.0e30

      DO 100 I = 1, NVALUS
         IF (VALUOK(I)) THEN
