C Revision 1.1  2009/03/25 04:47:53  gdsjaar
C Added blotII2 source since Copyright was asserted.
C
C Update copyright notice in suplib.
C
C Add blotII2 to config files.  Note that blot will not build yet since
C it requires some libraries that are still being reviewed for copyright
C assertion.
C
C Revision 1.3  2009/01/22 21:34:21  gdsjaar
C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.
C
C It can print the count and the names, but that is all
C at this time.
C
C Revision 1.2  2007/11/14 20:14:53  gdsjaar
C Added optional 'alive value' to the death on variable command.  The
C default value is 0.0, but you can now specify a different value to
C indicate aliveness (for example, the presto DEATH_DUMMY_VAR treats 1.0
C as the alive value).
C
C Example: DEATH ON DEATH_DUMMY_VAR 1

C   --MSFLAG sets the flags needed to plot a mesh.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   ANYDEF - OUT - true iff any deformed mesh is to be plotted
C   --   ANYUND - OUT - true iff any undeformed mesh is to be plotted
C   --   DOIXF - OUT - true iff the IXFAC array is needed
C   --   DON2B - OUT - true iff the IN2ELB array is needed
C   --   DOELED - OUT - true iff the deformed element quarilateral centers
C   --      are needed
C   --   DOELEU - OUT - true iff the undeformed element quarilateral centers
C   --      are needed
C   --   DODEAD - OUT - true iff dead nodes are needed
C   --   DONPS - OUT - true iff node set information is needed
C   --   DOESS - OUT - true iff side set information is needed
C   --   DOSCAL - OUT - true iff the zoom window limits need to be calculated
C   --   MINMSH, MAXMSH - OUT - the minimum and maximum mesh line types
C   --      to be displayed
C   --   MAXHID - OUT - the maximum hidden line option
