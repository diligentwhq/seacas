C   --*** DBITIM *** (EXOLIB) Read database time step times
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 11/11/87
C   --
C   --DBITIM reads all time steps of the database, storing the time for
C   --each step in dynamic memory.  It also sets the number of time steps.
C   --If there is a dynamic memory problem, the routine returns immediately
C   --without issuing an error message.  If there is a read error, a
C   --warning is printed and the step with the error is ignored.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NDB - IN - the database number
C   --   OPTION - IN - ' ' to not store, '*' to store all, else store options:
C   --      'W' to store whole times only
C   --      'H' to store history times only
C   --   EXODUS - IN - true iff this is an EXODUS file
C   --   NVARNP - IN - the number of nodal variables
C   --   NELBLK - IN - the number of element blocks
C   --   NVAREL - IN - the number of element variables
C   --   ISEVOK - IN - the element block variable truth table;
C   --      variable i of block j exists iff ISEVOK(j,i)
C   --   NSTEPS - OUT - the number of database time steps
C   --   NSTEPW - OUT - the number of whole (versus history) database time steps
C   --   A - IN/OUT - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   KTIMES - OUT - the dynamic memory index of TIMES (if OPTION)
C   --   KWHOLE - OUT - the dynamic memory index of WHOTIM (if OPTION);
C   --      WHOTIM(i) is true iff TIMES(i) is a whole (versus history) time step
C   --   * - return statement if error encountered, message is printed
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned in front of first time step upon entry;
C   --upon exit positioned at end of file.
