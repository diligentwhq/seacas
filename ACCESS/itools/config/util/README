This directory contains some things the standard X11 util/scripts doesn't.

which.csh, which.1 - csh version of which and man page.  From the
	redistributable BSD sources on ftp.uu.net.
which.sh - Bourne shell version of which.


bsdinst.sh and install.sh are part of the X11 distribution; you
may need to use them if your system doesn't have a working BSD
version of install.  bsdinst.sh is more commonly used.  install.sh
is used on Crays.  I find that install.sh works better than bsdinst
on HP systems as well.  aminstall.sh is used under Amoeba.
