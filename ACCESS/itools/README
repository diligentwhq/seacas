This distribution contains imake, a set of configuration files, and some
related configuration programs.  The build and installation instructions
may be found in Appendix B of:

	Software Portability with imake (2nd edition), by Paul DuBois
	Published by O'Reilly & Associates (1996, ISBN 1-56592-055-4)
	(This is a presumptive date, since the 2nd edition isn't out yet.)

The instructions in Appendix B should also be available online in
the directory from which you obtained this distribution, in the
file appb.ps or appb.txt (or appb.ps.{gz,Z} or appb.txt.{gz,Z} if the
site stores the files in gzip'ed or compress'ed format).

Important Note: The command for building the distribution is:
	% make World
(or)	% make World BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS="<flags>"
Do *NOT* run a bootstrapper like xmkmf or imboot to try to generate
a Makefile from the Imakefile in the distribution root.  The Makefile
in the root is written by hand; running a bootstrapper destroys it
and you will not be able to build the distribution.  If you run a
bootstrapper inadvertantly, you can restore the Makefile like this:
	% cp Makefile.sav Makefile

Most of this distribution was derived directly from the distribution of
the X Window System, Version 11, Release 6.1.

imboot, msub, and imdent (in config/extras) and which (in config/util) are
not part of X.

If your perl is not in /usr/local/bin/perl, you may want to change the
value of PERLPATH in config/extras/Imakefile.

If you don't want to use /usr/local/lib/config as the imboot configuration
root directory, change the value of CONFIGROOTDIR in config/extras/Imakefile.

The config/misc directory contains odds and ends that might be useful or of
interest.  However, most of it is currently from the R5 version of this
distribution, so I'm not sure how much they still apply:
- XNotes.* files: These are imake-related parts of the X11R5 release notes
They contain some information on building imake that might be useful.
- The other files relate to building imake on systems not supported by the
"official" X11R5 release.
- One file that IS applicable to R6.1 is md-patch01, which you should
consider applying to help makedepend process macros defined as hex
constants.

Some of the differences from the original X stuff:

- Most of the original files were mode 444 (read only), the presumption being
that you would just use them to build and install X, but not modify them.
I'm presuming that you may very well want to mess around with anything that's
here, consequently all the files are writable.

- Many of the Imakefiles and a few other files were changed from the originals
in the X11R6.1 distribution.  Of particular note:

	- Installation targets are all install.prog, where prog is the
	program you want to install.  You can also run "make install" to
	install everything built in a given directory and its
	subdirectories.

Change Log:

18 July 1996
- Renamed config/aux to config/extras because aux is a reserved name
under Windows NT.
